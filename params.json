{"name":"Hackasoton Landing Page","tagline":"Wow page for Hackasoton","body":"### What is this?\r\n\r\nThis is the source code for the Hackasoton landing / presetation page template.\r\n\r\n#### How to use it?\r\n\r\nIf you wanna see it locally, just do : \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone http://github.com/sabinmarcu/hackasoton-wow.git\r\n$ cd hackasoton-wow\r\n$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow go to `[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)` and see it for yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you wanna tinker with the code, just do : \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone http://github.com/sabinmarcu/hackasoton-wow.git\r\n$ cd hackasoton-wow\r\n$ git checkout -b master\r\n$ git pull origin master\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom now on, you can simply do :\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm install -g grunt-cli\r\n$ sudo grunt\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf port 80 is available, it will use that. If port 80 is not available, or you don't have root permission (unlikely), just do `$ grunt superalternate` and it will use port 8000. This way (both of the options) the nodejs server bundled will compile the app / interface every time you make a request. All of the necessary stuff is located in the `src/` folder. Data files like languages, styles, images, fonts, views, whatever are located in the `src/data` folder, while the javascript (livescript, coffeescript, whateverscript) logic files are located in the `src/classes` folder. Have fun! :)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
